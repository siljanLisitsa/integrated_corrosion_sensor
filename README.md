# Integrated Corrosion Sensor
Final project spring 2023 (Project II) for Computer Engineering Technology and Computing Science at Algonquin College

## Notes

### Sources
As stated in the code notes in Integrated_Corrosion_Sensor.ino, the following sources were referenced in the making of this sketch:
[Arduino tutorial Simple Web Server Wifi](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFiNINA/blob/master/examples/SimpleWebServerWiFi/SimpleWebServerWiFi.ino), [Arduino tutorial SHT31 Test](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SHT31/blob/master/examples/SHT31test/SHT31test.ino), [OHMMETER USING ARDUINO by PrinceT1](https://www.instructables.com/OHMMETER-USING-ARDUINO/) and [How To Write Arduino Sensor Data to a CSV File on a Computer by G. Lambert](https://www.circuitbasics.com/logging-arduino-data-to-files-on-a-computer/).  

### Programs

This sensor is run using the Arduino IDE, [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) (for storing sensor data), and any browser (used to display live sensor readings).

## The project

The purpose of the project was to work from a given design to build a sensor to detect corrosion of a material using factors of time, (ambient) humidity, temperature, and resistance (of the material, in ohms). The Arduino used was the Uno Wifi Rev2.
